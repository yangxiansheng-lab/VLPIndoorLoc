This directory is dedicated to calibrating LED lights in an environment devoid of ambient light. Specifically, while maintaining a constant height for the photodetector (PD) at 0.29 meters, we gathered all LEDs's received signal strength (RSS) values at each positions to facilitate the calibration of all LEDs simultaneously. The coordinates of the LEDs are as follows: LED1 (0.095, 0.628, 2.829), LED2 (3.300, 0.275, 2.831), LED3 (1.803, 2.570, 2.838), LED4 (0.331, 5.005, 2.838), and LED5 (3.048, 4.875, 2.828). Consequently, we provide these coordinates for each point in the "Reference Position.csv" file located in the corresponding peer directory.
