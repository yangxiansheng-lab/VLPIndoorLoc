This directory is dedicated to the individual calibration of each LED light in an environment where ambient lighting is unevenly distributed. Specifically, we introduce artificial ambient lighting to create a scenario with uneven ambient light, as depicted in Fig. 9. During the calibration process, while maintaining a constant height for the photodetector (PD) at 0.3 meters, we meticulously collected received signal strength (RSS) values at various distances for each LED light individually. The heights of LEDs are as follows: 2.829 meters for LED1, 2.831 meters for LED2, 2.838 meters for LED3, 2.838 meters for LED4, and 2.828 meters for LED5. As a result, we provide both the 3D distance and the 2D distance from the PD to each LED in "reference position.csv".
