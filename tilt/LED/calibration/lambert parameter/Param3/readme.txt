The data collection process here follows the method illustrated in Figure 11(c) of the paper. We maintained a constant height (90 cm) directly beneath each LED light while tilting the photodetector (PD) at different angles. Optical intensity data was collected in this manner, intended for estimating the Lambertian parameter M for the PD using formula (7).The angle with respect to the horizontal plane is:0,10,20,30,40,50,60 degree.
