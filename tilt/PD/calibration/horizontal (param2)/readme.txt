The data collection process here follows the method illustrated in Figure 11(b) of the paper. The photodetector (PD) was maintained at a horizontal level and constant height, while the optical intensity data was collected at various distances from each LED. This data is intended for estimating the Lambertian parameters (M + m_i + 2) for both the LEDs and the PD using formula (6). The height of the PD is 2cm. The 2D distance (m) from the LED light is 0, 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00; The 3D distance (m) from the LED light is 2.800, 2.844, 2.973, 3.176, 3.441, 3.753, 4.103, 4.482, 4.88, 4.50, 5.73; Since LED3 is located at the center, its maximum horizontal distance is 3 m. Finally, we  plot the relationship curve of log(d) and log(P), the  Lambertian parameters (M + m_i + 2) can be estimated using the slope of the curve.
